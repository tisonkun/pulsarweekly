# ðŸ“¨ #2: Project Health

Hi everyone!

This is the second issue of Pulsar Weekly. [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) is an open-source, distributed messaging and streaming platform built for the cloud.

Asaf started a discussion about [Committer Emiratus status](https://lists.apache.org/thread/3b0ojfyhjdgg4wcd0c4t0dftt0748r9s). A few of committers and PMC members expressed their opinions on merits and project health. You can learn how the Pulsar community works and what they think highly of on contribution.

For further reading, I recommend you read the [Apache Pulsar Contribution Guide](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/). And if you read Chinese, I have a blog on [maintainer criteria](https://www.tisonkun.org/2022/09/12/maintainer-criterions/) for helping you get involved in the community.

## Releases and Candidates

* Baodi Shi delivered Pulsar Node.js Client Release 1.8.1. You can [find it on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pulsar-client) and read the [release notes](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-node/releases/tag/v1.8.1).
* Christophe Bornet delivered Apache Pulsar Adapters Release 2.11.0. You can [find it on Maven](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.pulsar/pulsar-adapters/2.11.0).

## Core Developments

* Eric Shen from StreamNative [supported](https://lists.apache.org/thread/y7od6p2zyzo8lpy37mjdrkgmoln4cyt1) the proposal "Introducing Pulsar admin api to pulsar-client-go" and explained the in-house plan of incubating and donating pulsar-admin-go from streamnative org.
* Mattison found a [critical bug causing session notification thread deadlock](https://lists.apache.org/thread/odofmj9h8ln6blozhgkgmx0mbyll45dp). It may affect 2.8.5, 2.9.4, 2.10.3, and 2.11.0. The current workaround is restarting the broker. It's [fixed](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19754) upstream and would be backport and delivered in the next patch release if any.
* Kannar started a discussion about [reverse reading a topic](https://lists.apache.org/thread/k86wy7g8s9vfpo2j9o946cmfk7fg5x5d). If you have similar thoughts for such usages on Pulsar, you can share your ideas in the thread also.
* Yunze Xu started a discussion about [PIP-254: Support configuring client version at SDK level](https://lists.apache.org/thread/65cf7w76tt23sbsjnr8rpfxqf1nt9s9l). If you're developing a Pulsar client, you may be interested in this topic.
