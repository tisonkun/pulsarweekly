# ðŸ“¨ #1: Releases Maintenance

Hi everyone!

This is the first issue of Pulsar Weekly, an unofficial newsletter that brings you news about the development of [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) and its open and inclusive community.

As this is the first issue, it can include some items happened a few weeks ago.

<!-- truncate -->

The community released [Apache Pulsar 2.11.0](https://pulsar.apache.org/blog/2023/01/20/Apache-Pulsar-2-11-0/) at January 11, 2023. And the next release (3.0.0) will be the first long-term support release.

Here are threads about releases maintenance in the pass weeks:

* Matteo Merli started [the vote of PIP-175](https://lists.apache.org/thread/pqkh9d784krtk0jrfcs164kwrl303m7l), "Extend time based release process", which defines the long-term support release. The vote has passed.
* Enrico Olivelli started a discussion about [stop cherry-picking (breaking) changes to the released branches](https://lists.apache.org/thread/qfz1c52ddndf6rqj0nxc0p9ktz6goh7g).
* tison wrote the [release policy](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/release-policy/) page for converting the proposal to a user-friendly document.
